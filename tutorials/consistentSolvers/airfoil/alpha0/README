README - airfoil on low angle of attack
========================================

1. potentialFoam
2. consistentSimpleFoam (simpleFoam): will convergence, so there is no direct need for an unsteady solver.
3. consistentPimpleFoam: starts from the steadystate solution from 2 (consistentSimpleFoam). Almost nothing will change, due to the steadyness of the flow.
